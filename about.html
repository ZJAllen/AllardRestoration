      <h2>Hi, I'm Zach Allen</h2>

      <p>
        Thanks for checking out my site.  The main purpose for this site is so I can personally document the journey of the restoration of the 1953 Allard Palm Beach.  Feel free to hop on over to the <a href="contact">Contact</a> page to send me any questions or comments you may have.  In the meantime, let me introduce myself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Like the title says, my name is Zach Allen.  I'm an Engineer for a major automotive company, where I started working in June of 2016.  I graduated from the University of Florida with a Bachelor's of Science in Mechanical Engineering in 2016.  I have liked cars for quite some time, but I started this project with very little experience actually working on them.  I’ve learned a ton so far, and I learn something new each day I work on this car - that’s half the fun!
      </p>

      <p>
        The Allard, as I explained on <a href="project">The Project</a> page, was inherited by my mother from her father upon his passing in 2002.  From the day my dad drove it to our house for the first time, I fell in love with the car.  It wasn't anything too special - there's no power and the styling is nothing to be impressed by - but I just thought the car was so cool!  I knew from Day 1 that I wanted to own this car.  A lot of cosmetic work is required, but right now I’m focusing on getting it back up and running and on the road.
      </p>

      <p>
        As I mentioned, I have almost no practical experience working on cars, let alone restoring a car from the 1950s.  Therefore, this journey is going to be one filled with learning - from watching YouTube videos, to scouring the Internet for ideas, to requesting support from the experienced individuals at the <a href="https://www.allardregister.org" target="_blank">Allard Register</a> and others involved with restoring old cars.  I'll be chronicling the restoration of this vehicle over on my <a href=".">Photos</a> page so please peruse them at your leisure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thanks again for checking out this site, and I hope you enjoy my perils and successes throughout this adventure.
      </p>
